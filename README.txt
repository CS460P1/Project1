What works: This program accuractely tokenizes scheme code, and operates in the manner specified in class. It catches
     	    numerous edge cases, reports errors accurately, and ignores comments.

What doesn't work: We have attempted to find all possible edge cases, but more could be alluding us.

How to run:
    1. Compile with 'make' to generate 'P1.out'
    2. 'make run' to execute with P1-0.ss source file
